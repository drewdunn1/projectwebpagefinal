        <p id="newclick">As you can see from the table above, the average rate of increase for the companies during times of pandemics is considerably higher than when they are not in times of pandemics. I chose to graph Apple because it was the stock that was the most stable and had the least amount of outliers. The graph shows that although there are some time periods that have greater increases than the two years of pandemics, the increase during those pandemics is considerably higher than the majority of the other years. </p>
