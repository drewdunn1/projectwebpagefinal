   <header id="header10">How Pandemics Have Caused Many Tech Stocks To Increase At A Much Higher Rate Than Usual</header> 
        <p id="margin">My project is going to focus on how many major tech companies' stocks have skyrocketed in price since COVID-19 hit the U.S. It is most likely due to the fact that we have been indoors way more than usual which leads to us using many technological services at an unusually high rate. Some major examples of stocks that have gone up include Amazon, Apple, Zoom, and many others.</p>

            <header id="second">Preliminary Questions</header>
            <ol>
            <li>What major companies have benefited the most from this outbreak?</li>
              
            <li>Has it been a gradual increase in prices or was there a certain time frame with an extremely high spike?</li>
            <li>Will prices continue to go up or have they peaked?</li>
                    </ol>

        <header id="second">Why I'm Interested</header>
        <p id="margin">About two months ago, I started investing in stocks and since then I have been extremely intrigued by it. When I was first deciding which companies to invest in, I checked how the prices have changed in the past year or month. I started to see that many of the major tech companies improved by exponential rates in the past 6 months or. I realized that this major increase began right after COVID hit the U.S.. I'm interested in the answers to the questions above because hopefully if I start to notice patterns it will help me predict what stocks are going to go up and by how much.</p></div>
